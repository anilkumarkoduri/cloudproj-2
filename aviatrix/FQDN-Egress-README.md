## Aviatrix FQDN Egress Filtering on the AWS Cloud


This Quick Start builds a highly available, secure Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) Egress Filtering service on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in about 10 minutes. It automatically deploys an Aviatrix Controller for enabling Egress Filtering in a new or existing virtual private cloud (VPC).

With this Quick Start, you can connect to VPCs in the AWS Cloud with enhanced security, and access your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, applications, and services. The Aviatrix Controller deploys Aviatrix gateways in your VPCs, and configures egress security policies across all gateways.

After youâ€™ve used this Quick Start to deploy the Aviatrix Controller in one of your VPCs, the Egress Security wizard in the controller helps you deploy and configure Aviatrix gateways for Egress Filtering.

The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying Aviatrix Controller into a new VPC on AWS
- Deploying Aviatrix Controller into an existing VPC on AWS

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
