## Aviatrix User VPN on the AWS Cloud


This Quick Start builds a highly available user VPN solution on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in about 10-15 minutes. It deploys the Aviatrix Controller, Aviatrix gateways, authentication services, and log analytics.

The Aviatrix User VPN enables you to connect directly to the AWS Cloud workloads from remote locations. You can assign each VPN user to a profile that gives access privileges to a multicloud network, hosts, protocols, and ports.

The point-and-click, centralized management console (with REST API support) manages distributed gateways that CloudOps and network engineers can operate without needing deep networking skills.

After you deploy the Quick Start, and take advantage of the User VPN Wizard to establish your User VPN service, you can extend the environment beyond the AWS Cloud. By using the Aviatrix Controller, you can configure VPN access to other VPCs, other network providers, on-premises infrastructure, or other public cloud providers.

The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying Aviatrix Controller into a new VPC on AWS
- Deploying Aviatrix Controller into an existing VPC on AWS

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
